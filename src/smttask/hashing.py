"""
A set of functions for computing stable hashes on a wide variety of Python objects.
Stable in the sense that the same object should always return the same hash.

Note that this is NOT achieved by using Pythonâ€™s builtin `hash`, which is purposefully
not stable across sessions for security reasons.

Our target use case is producing short unique identifiers ('digests') to track
scientific computations, based on the parameters used for those computations.

The basic strategy we use is to convert objects to bytes, 
We try to fix conventions wherever possible, so that in many cases hashes should
be conserved even across machines, but this is difficult to guarantee in all cases.

.. Tip:: The following function can be used to calculate the likelihood
   of a hash collision based on the length of digests::

       def p_coll(N, M):
         '''
         :param N: Number of distinct hashes. For a 6 character hex digest,
            this would be 16**6.
         :param M: Number of hashes we expect to create.
         '''
         logp = np.sum(np.log(N-np.arange(M))) - M*np.log(N)
         return 1-np.exp(logp)

    The builtin `hash` is not stable across sessions for security reasons.
    This `stablehash` can be used when consistency of a hash is required, e.g.
    for on-disk caches.

    For obtaining a usable digest, see the convenience functions
    `stablehexdigest`, `stablebytesdigest` and `stableintdigest`.

    Suitable as the return value of a `__hash__` method.

    .. Note:: Although this method is provided, note that the purpose of a
       digest (a unique fingerprint) is not the same as the intended use of
       the `__hash__` magic method (fast hash tables, in particular for
       dictionaries). In the latter case, a certain degree of hash collisions
       is in fact desired, since that is required for the most efficient tables.
       Because this function uses SHA1 to obtain almost surely unique digests,
       it is much slower than typical `__hash__` implementations. This can
       become noticeable if it is involved in a lot of dictionary lookups.

    Parameters
    ----------
    o : object to hash (see `stablehash`)
    byte_len : int, Optional (default: 4)
        Number of bytes to keep from the hash. A value of `b` provides at most
        `8**b` bits of entropy. With `b=4`, this is 4096 bits and 10 digit
        integers.

def _tobytes(o) -> bytes:
    """
    Utility function for converting an object to bytes. This is used for the
    state digests, and thus is designed with the following considerations:

    1. Different inputs should, with high probability, return different byte
       sequences.
    2. The same inputs should always return the same byte sequence, even when
       executed in a new session (in order to satisfy the 'stable' description).
       Note that this precludes using an object's `id`, which is sometimes
       how `hash` is implemented.
       It also precludes using `hash` or `__hash__`, since that function is
       randomly salted for each new Python session.
    3. It is NOT necessary for the input to be reconstructable from
       the returned bytes.

    ..Note:: To avoid overly complicated byte sequences, the distinction
       guarantee is not preserved across types. So `_tobytes(b"A")`,
       `_tobytes("A")` and `_tobytes(65)` all return `b'A'`.
       So multiple inputs can return the same byte sequence, as long as they
       are unlikely to be used in the same location to mean different things.

    - None
    - bytes
