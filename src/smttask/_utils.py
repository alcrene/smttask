# Singleton (Copied from mackelab_toolbox.utils)

class Singleton(type):
    """Singleton metaclass
    Based on the pattern for numpy._globals._NoValue

    Although singletons are usually an anti-pattern, I've found them useful in
    a few cases, notably for a configuration class storing dynamic attributes
    in the form of properties.
    Before using a singleton, consider these alternate, more
    pythonic options:

      - Enum
        For defining unique constants
      - SimpleNamespace
        For defining configuration containers

    Example
    -------
    >>> from smttask.utils import Singleton
    >>> import sys
    >>>
    >>> class Config(metaclass=Singleton):
    >>>     def num_modules(self):
    >>>         return len(sys.modules)
    >>> config = Config()

    Attempting to create a new instance just returns the original one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    src: Path-like
        Returned path starts from here.
    dst: Path-like
        Returned path points to here. If ``relpath`` is the returned path, then
        `dst` points to the same location as concatenating `src` and ``relpath``.
    through: Path-like

        through `through`, even when unnecessary.
    resolve: bool

        It is hard to construct an example where doing this has an undesirable
        effect, so leaving to ``True`` is recommended.

      - To copy a configuration file which isn't tracked with version control.
      - To update said configuration file with values from a template file.

      level of the project; 2) that they are not tracked with version control;
      and 3) that they are compatible with the `configparser` module.

######################## Normalization to bytes ################################
# The code below implements a generic _tobytes function, which tries its       #
# best to convert a wide variety of inputs into a bytes sequence which can     #
# be hashed. This functionality is currently only really used by               #
# `workflows.SeedGenerator` (and there, limited to `_normalize_entropy`);      #
# the rest of smttask only needs support for hashing  str and int.             #
# There is also the possibility that we could reimplement the                  #
# functionality below using Serializable.reduce; this would avoid the need for #
# all the type cases. OTOH, Serializable.reduce needs to allow bi-directional  #
# conversion, whereas here this is not an issue, making the logic here         #
# ultimately simpler and faster.                                               #

def _tobytes(o) -> bytes:
    """
    Utility function for converting an object to bytes. This is used to
    generate unique, stable digests for arbitrary sequences of objects:

    1. Different inputs should, with high probability, return different byte
       sequences.
    2. The same inputs should always return the same byte sequence, even when
       executed in a new session (in order to satisfy the 'stable' description).
       Note that this precludes using an object's `id`, which is sometimes
       how `hash` is implemented.
       It also precludes using `hash` or `__hash__`, since that function is
       randomly salted for each new Python session.
    3. It is NOT necessary for the input to be reconstructable from
       the returned bytes.

    ..Note:: To avoid overly complicated byte sequences, the distinction
       guarantee is not preserved across types. So `_tobytes(b"A")`,
       `_tobytes("A")` and `_tobytes(65)` all return `b'A'`.
       So multiple inputs can return the same byte sequence, as long as they
       are unlikely to be used in the same location to mean different things.
