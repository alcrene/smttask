# Singleton (Copied from mackelab_toolbox.utils)

class Singleton(type):
    """Singleton metaclass
    Based on the pattern for numpy._globals._NoValue

    Although singletons are usually an anti-pattern, I've found them useful in
    a few cases, notably for a configuration class storing dynamic attributes
    in the form of properties.
    Before using a singleton, consider these alternate, more
    pythonic options:

      - Enum
        For defining unique constants
      - SimpleNamespace
        For defining configuration containers

    Example
    -------
    >>> from smttask.utils import Singleton
    >>> import sys
    >>>
    >>> class Config(metaclass=Singleton):
    >>>     def num_modules(self):
    >>>         return len(sys.modules)
    >>> config = Config()

    Attempting to create a new instance just returns the original one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    src: Path-like
        Returned path starts from here.
    dst: Path-like
        Returned path points to here. If ``relpath`` is the returned path, then
        `dst` points to the same location as concatenating `src` and ``relpath``.
    through: Path-like

        through `through`, even when unnecessary.
    resolve: bool

        It is hard to construct an example where doing this has an undesirable
        effect, so leaving to ``True`` is recommended.

      - To copy a configuration file which isn't tracked with version control.
      - To update said configuration file with values from a template file.

      and 3) that they are compatible with the `configparser` module.
