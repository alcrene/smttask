# Smtview

A collection of methods for viewing and filtering Sumatra record stores. Filtered records may be returned as a Pandas Dataframe, which is particularly convenient when working within a Jupyter notebook.

**Note**: This subpackage was originally designed to work with any Sumatra record store. If found to be appropriate, it could be split into its own package by making the few *smttask* dependencies optional.
