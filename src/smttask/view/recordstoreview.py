class RecordStoreView:
    """
    This class provides a read-only view to a subset of a `~sumatra.recordstore.RecordStore`.
    It is composed of two parts: the underlying record store, and an iterable
    which iterates over all or some of the records of that record store.
    A `RecordStoreView` provides an iterator which ensures that all returned
    elements RecordViews and therefore also read-only.

    The given iterable is not automatically converted to a list – a version
    underlined by a list (which thus supports len(), indexing, etc.) can be
    obtained with the .list property.
    `RecordStoreView` objects provide a filter interface. If `rsview` is such
    an object, then
        - `rsview.filter(cond)` is the same as `filter(rsview, cond)`
        - `rsview.filter.output_data()` keeps only records which produced output.
    The list of defined filters is stored in the dictionary
    ``rsview.filter.registered_filters``. Custom filters can also be defined
    with the decorator `smttask.view.recordfilter.record_filter`.

    Exception to the 'read-only' property: the methods `add_tag` and `remove_tag`
    must for obvious reasons modify the underlying record store.

    .. caution:: If constructed from a generator, iterating over the RecordStoreView
       will consume the generator. Use the `.list` property to ensure the
       used iterable is non-consumable.

        The typical use is to construct `RecordStoreView` from within the
        project, without parameters: `project` and `iterable` are then
        determined automatically.

        Main differences with sumatra RecordStore:

        - Read-only:
          Record store attributes are exposed as properties, and can't be
          accidentally modified.
          (However: `self.recordstore` returns the record store itself, and so
          is not read-only.)
        - Cached list: the first time `list` is called, the result is cached.
          With large record stores, this can save many seconds each time we
          iterate over records.
        - Many more filtering possibilities.
          `sumatra.recordstore.RecordStore` only allows filtering by tag;
          in contrast, `RecordStoreView` allows using arbitrary functions as
          filters, and provides a collection of built-in ones.
        - The `rebuild_input_datastore` method. This is used when a new version
          of the project code changes the expected location of input files;
          `rebuild_input_datastore` can then be used to create symlinks in
          all the expected input locations, without touching the original data.

        Split the RecordStoreView into multiple, disjoint views, based on their
        values in the fields specified in `split_fields`.
        This is analogous to a 'groupby' operation.
        Grouping is done in the order in which fields appear in `split_fields`.

        **Support for hierarchical keys**
        If a value returned by `get_field_value` is a `namedtuple` (or has
        a '_fields' attribute), then the subfields are extracted. For example,
        if the field 'time' returns namedtuples with fields 'start' and 'stop',
        then the split key field 'time' is replaced with 'time_start' and 'time_stop'.

        .. Caution:: The support for hierarchical keys is experimental and has
           the following limitations:

           - If a `get_field_value` returns a `namedtuple` for a given field
             name, its fields must be the same for all records.
           - Only one nesting level is currently supported.

        .. Caution:: If a field value is not hashable, it is converted to a string.

        Parameters
        ----------
        split_fields: List[str]
            The record attributes used to split record store views. See above
            for the treatment of hierarchical parameters.
        split_names: List[str]
            List of field names to use in the keys of the returned dictionaries.
            If not provided, inferred from `split_fields`.
        drop_unused_split_fields: bool
            Whether to omit from the key type fields which lead to no splitting.
            If True, fields are removed if they satisfy one of two conditions:
            1) All records have the same value for that field.
               (E.g. if 'α' is given in the split fields, but all records have
               the same value for 'α'.)
               This is independent of the ordering in `split_fields`.
            2) If higher priority fields would produce the same split.
               (E.g. if setting `split_fields` to either ['α', 'β'] or ['α']
               would produce the same splits; i.e. the values of 'β' are
               constant when conditioned on 'α'.)
               This depends on the ordering, with rightmost fields removed first.
            Default is True.
        get_field_value: Callable
            The function to use to recover field values from records.
            This is used e.g. by *smttask* to simplify the specification of
            parameters from nested task specifications.
            The function should have the same signature as `getattr`:
            (obj, attr:str, default) -> obj.attr or default
            If unspecified, it defaults to `view.config.get_field_value`.

    #   - Define _partial_list (initialized to [])

    #     to _list when they are returned
    #   - On subsequent calls, return mixed iterator: yield from _partial_list

        Update the 'reason' field for all records in the record store view.

        :param:reason: Either:
            - String to add to the records reasons (or to replace with)
            - Callback function, taking the record's 'reason' string and
              returning the updated one. If this function returns `None` or
              the unmodified reason string, the record is not modified.
        :param:mode: One of 'prepend', 'append', 'replace all', 'replace substr', 'callback'.
            Modes 'replace substr' and 'callback' can be left unspecified:
            they are inferred from the type of `reason`.

        If the mode is 'prepend' or 'append', and `reason` is already a substring
        of the record's 'reason' field **at any position**, then the record
        is not modified. This is to reduce the likelihood of accidentally
        growing the 'reason' field (e.g., with two functions each prepending
        different strings).

        .. Note:: Some standardizations are applied to all reason strings,
           even if they are are otherwise unmodified.

        **Modes**

        ``"prepend"``
           The new reason is `reason` + record.reason.

        ``"append"``
           The new reason is record.reason + `reason`.

        ``"replace all"``
           The new reason is `reason`.

        ``"replace substr"``
           For each {pattern: string} pair in `reason`, we call
           ``re.sub(pattern, string, reason)``. All occurences of 'pattern'
           are replaced by 'string'.

        ``"callback"``
           The new reason is ``callback(reason)``.

        ``"standardize"``
           Only apply the standardizations.

        **Standardizations**

        - Sequences (tuple, list, etc.) of length one are replaced by their
          first element. This is because while it is possible to store sequences
          in the 'reason' field, a string is really the expected format and
          better supported (both by the schema and by the UI).

        .. Note:: At the risk of stating the obvious, this function will modify
           the underlying record store.
