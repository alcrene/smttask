Graphical user interfaces
=========================

Sumatra has a command line interface and a web interface, but does not currently
have a graphical desktop client.

We will probably write one at some point, but we hope that other people will
also write their own, building on top of the tools and functionality provided in
the Sumatra package.

The reason we hope for multiple desktop clients is that everyone has their own
preferred workflow, and it seems unlikely that one graphical interface will
work equally well for everyone.
