=====================
Parallel computations
=====================

As well as launching computations on your local machine, Sumatra can launch
distributed, MPI-based computations on a cluster, at least for simple use-cases.
We assume you already have your hosts files, etc. set up. Then, to run your
computation on 17 nodes, run::

    $ smt run -n 17 default.param
    
(assuming you have already configured your default executable and main script
file). This will call ``mpiexec`` for you with the appropriate arguments.

If this is insufficiently configurable for you, please take a look at the
:class:`DistributedLaunchMode` class in ``launch.py`` within the source
distribution, and get in touch with the Sumatra developers, for example by
`creating a ticket`_ or asking a question on the `mailing list`_.
