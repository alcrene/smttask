Sumatra 0.4.0 release notes
===========================

*October 18th 2012*

Welcome to Sumatra 0.4.0!


Overview
--------

The biggest change in Sumatra 0.4 is the redesign of the browser-based interface,
launched with :command:`smtweb`. Thanks to the `Google Summer of Code`_ program,
Dmitry Samarkanov was able to spend his summer working on improving Sumatra, with
the results being a much improved web interface, better support for running
Sumatra on Windows, and better support for running Matlab scripts with Sumatra.
Many thanks to Google and to the INCF_ as mentoring organisation. In addition to
Dmitry's improvements, handling of input and output data files is much improved,
and Sumatra now captures and stores standard output (stdout) and standard error
(stderr) streams. More details on all of these, plus a bunch of minor
improvements and bug fixes, is given below. Finally, Sumatra no longer supports
Python 2.5 - the minimum requirement is Python 2.6.


Web interface
-------------

The Sumatra browser-based interface runs a local webserver on your computer,
and allows you to browse the information that Sumatra captures about your
analyses, simulations or other computations, including code versions, input
and output data files, parameter/configuration files, the operating system and
processor architecture.

The interface has been completely redesigned for Sumatra 0.4, and includes
dozens of large and small improvements, including:

  - a more modern, attractive design
  - the ability to select which columns to display in the record list view
  - the ability to search all of your records based on date, tags or full-text
  - side-by-side comparison of records
  - sorting of records based on any column
  - selection of multiple records by clicking or dragging for deletion, comparison and tagging

Furthermore, it is now possible to launch computations from the browser interface.

For more information, see :doc:`../web_interface` and `this blog post`_ from Dmitry
Samarkanov.


Data file handling
------------------

In earlier versions of Sumatra, the filename (or rather, the file path relative
to a user-defined root) was used as the identifier for input and output data
files. The problem with this, of course, is that it is possible to overwrite a
given file with new data. For this reason, Sumatra 0.4 now calculates and stores
the SHA1 hash of the file contents. If the file contents change, the hash will
also change, so that Sumatra can alert you if a file is accidentally overwritten,
for example.

Sumatra 0.4 also adds a new data store which automatically archives a copy of
the output data from your computations in a user-selected location. This data
store is accessible through the API as the :class:`ArchivingFileSystemDataStore`
class, or through the :command:`smt` command-line interface with the "--archive"
option to the "init" and "configure" commands.

Finally, Sumatra now allows the user the choice of whether to use an absolute or
relative path for the data store root directory. Using a relative path makes
projects easier to move and easier to access from other locations (e.g. with
symbolic links or NFS).


Matlab support
--------------

Sumatra can capture certain information for *any* command-line tool: input and
output data, version of the main codebase, operating system and processor
architecture, etc. For dependency information, however (i.e. which libraries,
modules or packages are imported/included by your main script), a separate
plugin is required for each language. Sumatra already has a dependency tracking
plugin for Python and for two computational neuroscience simulation environments,
NEURON and GENESIS. Sumatra 0.4 adds dependency tracking for Matlab scripts.


Recording of stdout and stderr
------------------------------

Sumatra 0.4 now supports recording and storage of the standard output and
standard error streams from your scripts.


Other new features
------------------

* added support for JSON-format parameter files;
* added :command:`smt export` command, which allows the contents of a Sumatra
  record store to be exported in JSON format;
* more information is now printed by :command:`smt list --long`;
* the Python dependency finder now supports scripts run with Python 3 (although
  Sumatra itself still needs Python 2);
* can now specify :class:`HttpRecordStore` username and password as part of the
  URL passed to :class:`smt init`;
* added support for markup using reStructuredText_ in the project description
* it is no longer required to have a script file, which makes it possible to
  use Sumatra with your own compiled executables. Further support for compiled
  languages is planned for the next release.


Bug fixes
---------

A `whole bunch of bugs`_ were fixed in Sumatra 0.4.
