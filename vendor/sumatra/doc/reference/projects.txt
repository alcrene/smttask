.. currentmodule:: sumatra.projects

The projects module defines the :class:`Project` class, which stores information
about a computation-based project and contains a number of methods for managing
and running computational experiments, whether simulations, analyses or
whatever. This is the main class that is used directly when using Sumatra within
your own scripts.
