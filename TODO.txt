Better default repository ?
  Have the default repository be the one where tasks are located

Make it easy to set an arbitrary location for the .smt folder.

Docs
----

- smttask.view  (-> viz ?)
- smttask.workflows
- Binding partial task inputs
- Generated tasks
- RecordStoreViewer
  + Viewer
  + Modifying records
    + add_tag
    + remove_tag
    + add_comment
- Use autodoc / autosummary for the user-api/cli.rst ?
  At present it doesn't seem to catch the docstrings (which excludes 
  elements from the TOC by default).

Tests
-----

- Test round-trip serialization with subclasses of NumPy arrays (see Task.digest_encoder)
- Join task (task_generators.py)
