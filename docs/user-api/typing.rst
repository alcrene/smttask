Custom types
-----------------

See the :doc:`related page <../serialization>` in the Getting Started guide.

SumatraTask provides a few custom types to deal with the certain special cases relevant for tasks (such as serializing the output of a task with multiple outputs).

The `scityping <https://scityping.readthedocs.io/>`_ package provides serializable versions of many common types used in scientific applications, such as NumPy arrays.
