Custom types
-----------------

See the :doc:`related page <../serialization>` in the Getting Started guide.

SumatraTask provides a few custom types to deal with the certain special cases relevant for tasks (such as serializing the output of a task with multiple outputs).

The `mackelab toolbox <https://github.com/mackelab/mackelab-toolbox/blob/master/mackelab_toolbox/typing/typing_module.py>`_ provides serializable versions of many common types used in scientific applications, such as NumPy arrays.
