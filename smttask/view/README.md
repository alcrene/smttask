# Smtview

A collection of methods for viewing and filtering Sumatra record stores. Filtered records may be returned as Pandas Dataframe, which is particularly convenient when working within a Jupyter notebook.

**Note**: This subpackage is designed to have no dependencies on *smttask*. If we find that to be appropriate, it could be split into its own package.
