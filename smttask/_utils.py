Elements of `utils` which don't depend on any other module within smttask,

This is a private module used internally to solve import cycles;
external code that uses these functions should import them from *smttask.utils*.

def lenient_issubclass(cls: Any, class_or_tuple) -> bool:

def relative_path(src, dst, through=None, resolve=True):
    """
    Like pathlib.Path.relative_to, with the difference that `dst` does not
    need to be a subpath of `src`.

    In typical use, `src` would be point to directory, and `dst` to a file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    src: Path-like
        Returned path starts from here.
    dst: Path-like
        Returned path points to here. If ``relpath`` is the returned path, then
        `dst` points to the same location as concatenating `src` and ``relpath``.
    through: Path-like
        Generally does not need to be provided; by default it is obtained with
        `os.path.commonpath`. When provided, the returned path always goes
        through `through`, even when unnecessary.
    resolve: bool
        Whether to normalize both `src` and `dst` with `Path.resolve`.
        It is hard to construct an example where doing this has an undesirable
        effect, so leaving to ``True`` is recommended.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from smttask.utils import relative_path
    >>> pout = Path("/home/User/data/output/file")
    >>> pin  = Path("/home/User/data/file")
    >>> relative_path(pin, pout, through="/home/User/data")
    PosixPath('../output/file')
