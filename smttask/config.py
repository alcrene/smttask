    Global store of variables accessible to tasks; they can be overwritten
    in a project script.

    Public attributes
    -----------------
    project: Sumatra project variable.
        Defaults to using the one in the current directory. If the .smt project
        folder is in another location, it needs to be loaded with `load_project`

        Setting this value also sets `view.config.project` to the same value.
    record: bool
        When true, all RecordedTasks are recorded in the Sumatra database.
        The `False` setting is meant as a debugging option, and so also prevents
        prevents writing to disk.
    allow_uncommitted_changes: bool
        By default, even unrecorded tasks check that the repository is clean.
        Defaults to the negation of `record`.
        I'm not sure of a use case where this value would need to differ from
        `record`.
    cache_runs: bool
        Set to true to cache run() executions in memory.
        Can also be overridden at the class level.
    max_processes: int
        Maximum number of Task processes to allow running simultaneously on
        the machine. Uses lock files in the system's default temporary directory
        to detect other processes.

        Negative values are equivalent to #CPUs - `max_processes`.
    process_number: int
        Retrieve the value of the environment variable SMTTASK_PROCESS_NUM.
        This variable is set automatically when executing `smttask run` on the
        command line, and can be used e.g. to assign different cache files
        to simultaneously executing tasks.
        If the environment variable is not set, 0 is returned.
